FireBase 

>>2 problems in sqlite database..

-data is very limited to that par dev , we cant access the data in other device.
-we can store the limited data in DB.. 

>>hosting server is required(AWS,ORACLE, MySQL).
again problem is from our mobile application directly we can't communicate with database server in android.[Not Possible]

>>Alternative : [Swiggy, Naukari, Whatsapp>>>>>> How??????]
	:::::::
This communication is possible with any one of the web Technologies[Java, .Net, Php](Web services, JSON XML Parsing etc..... all these things are required).


>>Best Alternative is Android Firebase.
-no need to have any server side knowledge.
-no need od any database.
-no need of deploy any db server.

>>Android Firebase is Providing..

Every Application have storing the user credentials..(Database)


These are the major concepts apart from this Firebase is providing lot of features
>>Mainly the mobile Application developer will get a requirement of, in following places will need the server side support
Authentication
Database
Storage
Notifications
